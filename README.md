# To-Do

This to-do list was one of my first coding practice I made as I started my studies. It has the possibilitys to show all entered to-dos, to add entrys, to delete them, to close the program, to edit entrys, to set a date to a entry, to show all to-dos with the related date and to sort all to-dos by first to last or last to first
